*OpenAM Sample Policy Evaluation Plugins*

For instructions on using these sample policy evaluation plugins
with OpenAM see the chapter,
*[Customizing Policy Evaluation](http://openam.forgerock.org/openam-documentation/openam-doc-source/doc/dev-guide/index/chap-policy-spi.html)*,
in the OpenAM *Developer's Guide*.

Before building the sample plugins,
update the OpenAM version in the POM
to match the version of OpenAM that you are using.
The line to update is:
