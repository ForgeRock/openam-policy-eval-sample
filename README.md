*OpenAM Sample Policy Evaluation Plugins*

Note: If you are using OpenAM 11.0.0, get the sample corresponding to that release.
See <https://github.com/markcraig/openam-policy-eval-sample/releases/tag/v11.0.0>.

DRAFT in progress... doc is not rewritten yet

For instructions on using these sample policy evaluation plugins
with OpenAM 12.0.0 see the chapter,
*[Customizing Policy Evaluation](http://docs.forgerock.org/en/openam/12.0.0/dev-guide/index/chap-policy-spi.html)*,
in the OpenAM *Developer's Guide*.

Before building the sample plugins,
update the OpenAM version in the POM
to match the version of OpenAM that you are using.
The line to update is:

    <openam.version>13.0.0-SNAPSHOT</openam.version>

This sample is being tested with OpenAM 13.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
