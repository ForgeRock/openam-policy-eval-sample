*OpenAM Sample Policy Evaluation Plugins*

For instructions on using these sample policy evaluation plugins
with OpenAM 11.0.0 see the chapter,
*[Customizing Policy Evaluation](http://docs.forgerock.org/en/openam/11.0.0/dev-guide/index/chap-policy-spi.html)*,
in the OpenAM *Developer's Guide*.

Before building the sample plugins,
update the OpenAM version in the POM
to match the version of OpenAM that you are using.
The line to update is:

    <openam.version>11.0.0</openam.version>

This sample has been tried with OpenAM 11.0.0.
